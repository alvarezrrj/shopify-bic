This is my version of the Backend Coding Challenge for the Developer Intern at Shopify

The app contains three sections: two forms and a table.

The first form allows the user to add a new item to the database by choosing a name for it, amount
and location.
The second form allows for adition of a new location into the database. Duplicate locations will not be allowed.

The table displays all items on the database, which are retrieved on page load and updated every time an item is added/deleted/edited. Finally, the last column on every row contains buttons for deletion and edition of individual items. The 'edit' button opens up a form which is prepopulated with an item's current state.
